# SimpleGenderClassifier
This is a simple program built in Python that predicts a person's gender based on inputs of height, weight, and shoe size
The code is based off of a Youtube video https://youtu.be/T5pRlIbr6gg that is part of an online data science course using Python. 
Here's how it works:
1) Load in the historical data
2) Create a model using Decision Tree Classifiers and predict gender
3) Create a model using Logistic Regression and predict gender
4) Create a model using K Neighbors Classifier and predict gender
